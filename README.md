## IBM-AI-BASE-DIABETES-PREDICTION-SYSTEM

### Overview

The AI-BASE-DIABETES-PREDICTION-SYSTEM is a machine learning-based application for predicting the risk of diabetes in individuals. This project aims to provide a user-friendly and accurate tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters.

### Features

- Predicts the risk of diabetes based on user-provided health data.
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model to make predictions.
- Provides easy-to-understand results, including the risk percentage and recommendations.
- Helps individuals make informed decisions about their health.

### Libraries Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org): The programming language used for developing the application.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/): A lightweight web framework for creating the web application.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A machine learning library for building and training the diabetes prediction model.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Used for numerical computations.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Used for data visualization.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Used for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used for styling and frontend design.
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/): Used for templating in Flask.

### Dataset

The machine learning model used in this system has been trained on a dataset of historical health data. To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. Acquire a diabetes-related dataset or use the provided dataset (if included).
2. Ensure that your dataset contains relevant features, such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and other health parameters.
3. Preprocess the data, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### Machine Learning Steps

1. Select a machine learning algorithm suitable for binary classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.
2. Train the selected model on the training data.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score).
4. Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
5. Save the trained model for use in the application.

### Model

The machine learning model used for diabetes prediction is based on [algorithm/model name]. You can find the code for training and evaluating the model in the `model` directory.
